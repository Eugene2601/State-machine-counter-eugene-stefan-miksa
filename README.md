# State machine counter eugene stefan miksa
This program counts up to three and down to zero using two buttons, one button is used for counting up and one is used for counting down.
The arduino is coupled to a 7-segment display using a binary controller. The states are stored in Enums for easy use. The buttons 
are from the CNC LED board we made.
